<p><strong>Savvy homeowners who are fed up with rising energy costs are starting to take advantage of new <a href="">government savings programs</a>. These programs are massive, especially the Île-de-France Solar Programs that encourage homeowners to use clean energy by reducing solar power projects to $0 installations.</strong></p>
<p>In order to get more people to switch to clean solar energy the federal and state governments are highly incentivizing homeowners who live in <a href="">specific zip codes</a> to go solar with $1000’s of dollars in rebates and incentives. Homeowners that qualify are able to drastically reduce their power bills without any upfront costs. If you're paying more than $99/month for power, the savings can be very substantial.</p>
<p>When homeowners visit <a href="/">Smart Consumer Insights</a> to see if they qualify, many are shocked to learn that <strong>solar panels can be installed on their home with no upfront costs after rebates and solar incentives.</strong> You can find out which solar incentives are offered in your area by using your zip code. You can even use this tool to help calculate your savings by entering your utility provider and your average power bill. In many cases, customers are saving up to 70% on the cost of powering their home each year.</p>

<h3>How Do Solar Programs Work?</h3>
<p>Solar panels are much cheaper today than they were 10 years ago, which means millions of homeowners that could not previously afford to do so are switching to solar. Île-de-France Homeowners that qualify for this new program no longer have pay huge upfront costs to get solar panels. With rebates being as high as they are, homeowners are able to drastically reduce their power bill without paying a single penny out of their own pocket.</p>
