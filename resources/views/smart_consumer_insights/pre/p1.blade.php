                <p class="commontxt">Power companies are fighting an uphill battle they are sure to lose and they’re blaming customers who are taking advantage of massive savings programs. Specifically, they are blaming State Rebates that incentivize homeowners to use clean energy <strong>by reducing solar power installation costs.</strong></p>
				<p class="commontxt">Until now, solar panels were less about saving money and more about environmental protection. In order to get more people to switch to clean solar energy companies are highly incentivizing homeowners who live in specific zip codes to go solar with <strong><a href="{{$finalURL}}" target="_blank">$1000’s of dollars in savings</a> and incentives that can cover the large costs</strong> associated with a new solar panel installation.</p>

              <p class="commontxt"> When  homeowners visit the <a href="{{$finalURL}}" target="_blank"><strong>{{$domainTitle}} Website</strong></a> to see if they qualify, many are shocked to learn that <strong>solar panels can be installed on their home with no upfront costs</strong> after rebates and solar incentives. You can find out which solar incentives are offered in your area by using your zip code. You can even use this tool to help calculate your savings by entering your utility provider and your average power bill. In many cases, customers are saving up to 50% on the cost of powering their home each year.</p>

<h2>How Do Solar Programs Work?</h2>

<p class="commontxt">Solar panels are much cheaper today than they were 10 years ago, which means millions of homeowners that could not previously afford to do so are switching to solar.  Homeowners that qualify for this new program no longer have to buy solar panels. With rebates being as high as they are, homeowners are able to <a href="{{$finalURL}}" target="_blank"><strong>drastically reduce their power bill</strong></a> without dealing with the upfront costs of installing solar panels. Before, solar companies would lose money if they were to rent or lease solar panels; now, one of the nation’s largest solar power providers now claims to be signing up a new solar panel customer every 5 minutes because of these incentivized programs.</p>
